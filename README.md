# EDA-TASK-5
### 📊 Task 5 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#### 🔍 Objective:
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to uncover insights, patterns, and trends from the Titanic dataset using Python.
#### 🛠 Tools Used:
* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook
#### 📁 Files Included:
* EDA practice.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with all analysis and visualizations.
* EDA_Report_Task_5.pdf: PDF summary of findings (optional upload).
* train.csv: Dataset used (optional if dataset is from Kaggle link).
#### 🔬 Key Analysis Performed:
* Dataset overview using .info() and .describe()
* Missing values analysis
* Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
* Correlation heatmap
* Histograms, boxplots, scatterplots
* Summary of insights
#### 📌 Insights Example (if using Titanic dataset):
* Female passengers had higher survival rates.
* Passengers in 1st class survived more than others.
* Age and fare distributions show right-skewed data.
* Strong correlation between Pclass and survival.
#### ✅ Outcome:
Gained hands-on experience in data visualization and extracting meaningful insights from real-world data.
